tcnc
====

Inkscape extension that generates G-code suitable for a four axis CNC cutter (XYZ plus tangent A)

Installing tcnc
---------------

I haven't tried it on Windows yet but the idea is to just copy the contents of tcnc/src into
wherever the Inkscape extension folder is.

### For Mac OS X and Linux:
Copy the contents of the tcnc/src folder into ~/.config/inkscape/extensions then
restart Inkscape.
